# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning
This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks that explore clustering algorithms and their applications in machine learning. One notebook focuses on DBSCAN and its implementation on the Breast Cancer and Wine Quality datasets. The second notebook covers K-Means clustering, applied to the Banknote Authentication dataset.

## Overview
These notebooks are designed to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical application insights into clustering algorithms, demonstrating how they can be used to uncover hidden patterns and groupings in data without prior labeling of outcomes.

Notebooks

### 1. DBSCAN Clustering
File: dbscan.ipynb

Description:
This notebook delves into the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm, known for its effectiveness in identifying outliers and handling clusters of varying shapes and sizes. It includes:

- A detailed explanation of how DBSCAN works, including its parameters such as epsilon and min_samples.

- Applications of DBSCAN to:

    - Breast Cancer Dataset: Cluster analysis to find patterns or groupings among cancer instances.

    - Wine Quality Dataset: Exploration of how wine quality data can be grouped based on physicochemical properties.

### 2. K-Means Clustering
File: K_Means_Clustering.ipynb

Description:
This notebook explores K-Means clustering, a popular method for partitioning data into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It covers:

- The basics of the K-Means algorithm, including selection of K and the algorithmâ€™s iterative process of assignment and update.

- Implementation of K-Means on:

    - Banknote Authentication Dataset: Using clustering to identify potential intrinsic groupings among different banknote measurements.
