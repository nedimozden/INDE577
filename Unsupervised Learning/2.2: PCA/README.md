# Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that explores the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction in two distinct datasets: Breast Cancer and Real Estate. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms a complex dataset into a simpler one without losing essential information.

## Overview
The notebook is designed as a detailed guide to understanding and implementing PCA, showcasing its ability to reveal underlying patterns in the data that might not be apparent in the original higher-dimensional space.

Description:
This notebook provides an in-depth look at PCA, covering:

- Theory of PCA: An introduction to PCA, discussing how it reduces dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.

- Applications of PCA:

    - Breast Cancer Dataset: Uses PCA to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions, helping to identify patterns related to cancer characteristics.

    - Real Estate Dataset: Applies PCA to explore underlying patterns in real estate data and how these relate to house prices.
