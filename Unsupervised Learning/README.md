# Unsupervised Learning Techniques
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploring unsupervised learning techniques, which involve clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods. Each notebook delves into a different technique, providing theoretical explanations along with practical implementations.

## Overview
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that deals with identifying patterns in data without inputting labels. This repository focuses on two main clustering techniques—K-Means and DBSCAN—and the dimensionality reduction method, PCA, demonstrating their applications in various datasets.

### Notebooks
1. Clustering Algorithms
Description:
This section includes two notebooks that cover the following clustering techniques:

K-Means Clustering: Explores the popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on their features.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Examines this clustering method known for its effectiveness in identifying arbitrary shaped clusters and outliers in data.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Description:
This notebook provides an in-depth look at PCA, a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction:

Explanation of how PCA reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables (principal components), which are uncorrelated and ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the data.
Applications of PCA to visualize high-dimensional data and improve the efficiency of other learning algorithms.
