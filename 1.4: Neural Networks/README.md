# Neural Networks:
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that explores the use of Neural Networks for predicting real estate prices and classifying breast cancer cases. The notebook is designed to provide a practical and educational look at applying neural networks in different contexts.

## Overview
The notebook serves as an educational tool to demonstrate:

- The principles of Neural Networks.

- Their application in both regression (Real Estate price prediction) and classification (Breast Cancer diagnosis).

Description:
This notebook is divided into two sections, each focusing on a specific dataset and task:

1. Real Estate Price Prediction:

- Uses the Real Estate dataset to predict house prices based on various features like house age, proximity to the nearest MRT station, and number of convenience stores.

- Includes data preprocessing, model building using a neural network, training, and evaluation.

- Visualizations of model loss and accuracy over epochs are provided for analysis.

2. Breast Cancer Classification:

- Applies a neural network to classify cases from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset as benign or malignant.

- Walks through the process of feature scaling, model creation, training, and validating performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Features loss and accuracy visualizations during training to assess model convergence.
