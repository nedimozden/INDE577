##Perceptron Model

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. 
The Perceptron model in this project demonstrates how it can classify data into two categories based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.
This will be implemented on a Banknote Forgery dataset, with explanations

#Model Description
The Perceptron algorithm attempts to find a linear boundary that separates the two classes by adjusting weights based on the inputs that are misclassified. 
The weights are updated in a manner that would correct the misclassification, gradually improving the model with each iteration over the training set.
