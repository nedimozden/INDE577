# Logistic Regression:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that focuses on Logistic Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression using the Banknote Authentication dataset.

## Overview
The notebook is an educational resource that provides:

- A detailed explanation of Logistic Regression.

- A practical implementation to classify whether a banknote is authentic or forged.

### Notebook
Logistic Regression
File: logistic_regression.ipynb

Description:
This notebook explores Logistic Regression through:

- An introduction to the theory behind Logistic Regression and how it is used for binary classification tasks.

- Application of Logistic Regression to the Banknote Authentication dataset to predict the authenticity of banknotes based on attributes derived from images.

- A step-by-step guide through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, including accuracy assessment and confusion matrix visualization.

- Visualizations to aid in understanding the distribution of data and the decision boundary created by the model.
