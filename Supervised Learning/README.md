# Supervised Learning Models in Machine Learning
This repository is dedicated to exploring a variety of supervised learning models through a collection of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook delves into a different model, explaining its theory, implementation, and application with practical examples.

## Overview
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This repository covers several popular supervised learning algorithms, ranging from simple models like the Perceptron and Linear Regression to more complex models such as Neural Networks and Ensemble Methods.
