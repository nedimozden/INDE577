# Neural Networks:
This repository hosts two Jupyter notebooks: one exploring the use of Neural Networks for predicting real estate prices and classifying breast cancer cases, and the other performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using BERT. Each notebook is designed to provide a practical and educational look at applying machine learning techniques in different contexts.

## Overview
The notebook serves as an educational tool to demonstrate:

- The principles of Neural Networks.

- Their application in both regression (Real Estate price prediction) and classification (Breast Cancer diagnosis).

- The application of BERT for natural language processing tasks.

### Notebook
Neural Networks
File: neural_networks.ipynb

Description:
This notebook is divided into two sections, each focusing on a specific dataset and task:

1. Real Estate Price Prediction:

- Uses the Real Estate dataset to predict house prices based on various features like house age, proximity to the nearest MRT station, and number of convenience stores.

- Includes data preprocessing, model building using a neural network, training, and evaluation.

- Visualizations of model loss and accuracy over epochs are provided for analysis.

2. Breast Cancer Classification:

- Applies a neural network to classify cases from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset as benign or malignant.

- Walks through the process of feature scaling, model creation, training, and validating performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Features loss and accuracy visualizations during training to assess model convergence.

BERT for Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset:

Description: 
This notebook performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using BERT. It demonstrates data preprocessing, fine-tuning BERT, and evaluation for sentiment classification.
