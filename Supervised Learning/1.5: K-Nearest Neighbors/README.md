# K-Nearest Neighbors:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the application of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for the classification of banknotes as authentic or forged. This approach is part of a machine learning tutorial aimed at demonstrating the practical application of KNN in a real-world dataset.

## Overview
The notebook serves as a hands-on guide to understanding and implementing the KNN algorithm, providing:

- A thorough introduction to the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

- A detailed case study using the Banknote Authentication dataset.

Description:
This notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive walkthrough for applying KNN, featuring:

- An introduction to the principles of KNN and its use in classification tasks.

- Data preprocessing steps necessary for KNN implementation, such as feature scaling.

- The use of the scikit-learn library to implement KNN and evaluate its performance through accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

- Visualization of decision boundaries to better understand how KNN classifies new data points based on their neighbors.
