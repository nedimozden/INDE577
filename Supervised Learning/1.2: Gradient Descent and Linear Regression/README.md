# Machine Learning Techniques: Gradient Descent and Linear Regression
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that illustrate fundamental machine learning techniques: Gradient Descent and Linear Regression.

## Overview
The notebooks are educational tools designed to demonstrate the implementation and theory behind two fundamental algorithms in machine learning:

1. Gradient Descent
2. Linear Regression

Each notebook includes detailed explanations of the algorithm concepts, along with practical implementations on specific datasets or functions.

## Notebooks
### 1. Gradient Descent
File: gradient_descent.ipynb

Description:
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. It includes:

- An introduction to the Gradient Descent algorithm.

- Implementations of Gradient Descent to minimize two different functions:
    - A quadratic function
    - A more complex multivariable function
- Visualizations of the optimization process.

- Detailed explanations of each step and how Gradient Descent iteratively approaches the minimum of the function.

### 2. Linear Regression
File: linear_regression.ipynb

Description:
This notebook focuses on Linear Regression and its application using a real-world dataset:

- A thorough explanation of Linear Regression.

- An implementation of Linear Regression to predict real estate prices using the UCIML Real Estate Evaluation dataset.

- Visual analysis of the data and the regression results.

- Insights into the effectiveness of Linear Regression for the given data.
