# Decision Trees:
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook exploring the application of Decision Trees for both classification and regression tasks. The notebook uses two distinct datasets to demonstrate these applications: the Banknote Authentication dataset for classification and the Real Estate dataset for price prediction.

## Overview
The notebook provides a detailed educational approach to understanding Decision Trees, featuring:

- Fundamental concepts of Decision Trees, including how they make decisions and their advantages and disadvantages.

- Practical applications using two datasets: classifying banknotes as authentic or forged and predicting real estate prices.

Description:
This notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of Decision Trees through:

- Theory and Basics: An introduction to the decision-making process of trees, how they split data, and criteria for splitting.

1. Banknote Authentication:
    - Use of Decision Trees to classify banknotes based on attributes derived from images.
    
    - Evaluation of the model's performance through accuracy metrics and visualization of the tree structure.

2. Real Estate Price Prediction:

    - Application of Decision Trees to predict real estate prices from features such as house age, proximity to MRT stations, and number of convenience stores.

    - Discussion on how to prevent overfitting and underfitting in Decision Trees.

    - Evaluation of the model with metrics like R^2 and Mean Squared Error, and visualization of tree decisions.
